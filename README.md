"Because having to install an app with a GUI to edit text is the dumbest fucking thing ever"

## Dafuq?

It's yet another ASCii/ANSi editor, but this one's different.

- VIM will do the heavy-lifting with rendering, cursor movement, etc.
- It will be able to run anywhere that can run VIM and Python. ie. Lots of platforms.
- It'll be lightweight.
- It'll load quick AF!
- There'll be no Mono/.NET bloat needed.

It's time to stop with the horseshit GUI editors. Titansi will be the editor that should have been created a long time ago.
